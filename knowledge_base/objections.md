Objection Handling Library

This library combines all objection responses from Application Objections.docx and Debt Settlement Objections.docx.



🎯 Core Strategy

Handle the concern with confidence.



Tie it down with a “yes” (e.g., "Does that make sense?").











Pivot naturally back to the script.



Objections are opportunities to connect — turn negatives into positives.



Always keep the tone friendly, in control, and solution-oriented.





Remember: More Pitches = More Deals.



Application Objections

(This section was preserved from your original objections.md file)



"What company is this?"



"We're Advantage First Financial — we help clients access unsecured personal loans and financial solutions tailored to pay off debt... Most people use them to consolidate credit cards... Just out of curiosity, what do you think your current debt load is?”



"Can you call me later?"



“Absolutely — what time works best for you? ... Hey you know what if you want, I’ll just ask one or two quick questions now so I can have some real options ready when I call back. Sound good? Is it all credit cards or what kind of debt is that?"



"I want to look you up"



“Totally understand. Please do — we're very proud of our reputation... Our main site is adv1st.com, and you’ll see we have an A+ rating with the BBB and over 1,000 five-star reviews on Trustpilot..."



"My Credit isn't Good"



“No worries — we actually specialize in working with people who don’t have perfect credit. We work with a wide network of lenders, and you’d be surprised what’s possible. What do you do for work right now?”



"I never applied."



“You were likely pre-qualified through our system — maybe you saw us on Facebook, got a letter, or came through one of our financial partners. The good news is, the approval guidelines have recently opened up... Let me ask — how much are you paying monthly toward your credit cards right now?”



"What's the Rate? Can you beat my rate?"



“Great question — rates start as low as 5.99%... Best part? We never put clients in a worse position than they're already in — that’s part of our policy... What are your monthly payments looking like right now?"



Debt Settlement Objections

(This section is now populated from Debt Settlement Objections.docx)



"How is this going to affect my credit?"





Rebuttal #1: "Thats the best part! This program is regulated under federal guidelines and endorsed by the American Fair Credit Council. Right now, your credit is impacted because of high balances and utilization. As your debt gets paid down on the new terms, your credit worthiness improves. In about 6 months, we usually start seeing credit scores and lendability rise... Make sense?" 





Rebuttal #1b (Emotional): "I totally get it — I’ve been there... When I had debt, I thought it was my credit I was worried about, but really, it was the stress... Once your debt starts going down, your credit usually follows and improves. But the biggest win? No more stress. That’s priceless, right?" 





Rebuttal #1e (Technical): "Your credit is being impacted now due to high utilization and risk factors. This program helps fix that. Yes, you may see a temporary dip, but that’s normal. Once the high-interest is removed and the payments are on track, your credit begins recovering... Make sense?" 





If still stuck: "Honestly, and I mean this kindly... who cares? You’re finally breaking free from the cycle. You’re not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. Let’s focus on the solution, not the temporary discomfort." 



"I WANT TO THINK THIS OVER"



"It totally makes sense to take a moment. The good news is, you're not making a final decision today — this is just to see if you can even be approved. And with nearly $20 billion in debt resolved through our servicer, you're in excellent hands... So let me ask you, do you have any concerns with this?" 





"Old Settlement Programs / Debt consolidations"



"No, I would never recommend debt consolidation! \[Debt Resolution is] much more regulated / Federal Guidelines, AFCC... endorses the program. No Upfront Fees! Much Faster results... Debt Pooling... No direct effect on credit... Legal protection FULL" 



"I can just Refinance / Pull 401k"



"I totally get it... your home is an appreciating asset... Same with your retirement or 401k. It’s supposed to be protected and growing — not tapped to clean up unsecured debt. One of the biggest mistakes people make is liquidating... assets that are working for them just to pay down... credit cards that are working against them... The smarter play? Use this plan to restructure the debt... That way you preserve your assets and still eliminate the problem. Does it make sense?" 



"I'm getting a Tax Return / Money Soon"



"That’s great... Here’s what I would suggest — don’t spend it on debt. Seriously. That return is your opportunity to build a cushion... This program is going to save you $\_\_\_\_ per month, right? ...in one year, you could be sitting on two tax returns AND a year’s worth of extra savings — all while your debts are being paid off... That sounds like a win, right?" 



"Will I get sued by my creditors?"



"Fair question — and the short answer is: it’s rare. Around 1–2% of our clients ever see legal paperwork... But if it does happen, that’s why we’ve built legal protection directly into the program. The moment something is received, we prioritize that account. We negotiate quickly... We’ve got teams in place... to handle the entire process. You won’t lift a finger." 



"I feel morally obliged to pay off the debt"



"That says a lot about your character... But here’s the reality: most of your creditors have already made back the original principal. What’s left is compounding interest that keeps you stuck. This isn’t bankruptcy. You’re not walking away. You’re resolving it... The creditors still get paid... and in most cases, they’re even getting tax credits for doing so... You’re settling up. Responsibly. Make sense?" 



"I need to speak to my wife/husband"



"Totally get that. If I told my partner I was cutting our bills by $400 a month, they’d want me to move forward right away! Here’s what we’ll do — let’s first make sure you qualify. I’ll walk you through the disclosures, and then you can show your spouse the full outline. That way, you’re not talking about a problem at dinner tonight — you’re talking about a solution. Sound fair?" 



"Im working with another company now"



"That’s good — at least you’re trying to take action. Let me ask, how long have you been with them and what kind of results have you seen so far? ...Now, we switched to working with Freedom for a reason. 40% of our clients see results the first month and 70% within 90 days! ...They use a really cool tactic called debt pooling/collective barganging... That changes everything. Hence we have seen over 20 BILLION saved... So let’s at least see what you’re eligible for. No pressure — just numbers." 



"Will interest and late fees still accumulate while in the program?"



"Great question. At the very beginning... some creditors may continue to apply interest or fees... But once the new terms are locked in, that all stops. Not only that — the Freedom negotiates against those fees and charges as part of the resolution process... So don't worry if you see that. Make sense?" 



"What if these creditors don’t want to settle?"



"That’s extremely rare. Before you’re ever enrolled, your accounts go through a pre-approval check to ensure the creditors you have are already known to cooperate. We work with these creditors every single day... They know the process, they expect it... In fact, they prefer it over letting accounts go unpaid indefinitely." 



"Why didn’t I get approved for a loan?"



"Good question. Lenders are picky... But here’s the good news — you don’t need a loan to get out of debt. This resolution plan is designed for people who didn’t qualify for traditional financing. You’re not borrowing your way out. You’re restructuring, reducing, and moving forward." 



"Is this 'credit consumer counseling?'"



"No — it’s very different. Credit counseling... just reduces interest rates, but your payments stay roughly the same and it shows up as third-party assistance on your credit report for 7-10 years. Our plan works differently. You’ll see real balance reductions, you pay off debts faster, and nothing ever gets reported as 'enrolled in a program.'" 



"Do I stop making payments to my creditors?"



"Most clients do — and here’s why: those payments are going toward high interest and little progress. The moment you’re enrolled, you redirect those funds to your dedicated savings plan, and we start negotiating from there. All communications shift to us... Think of it like shifting from spinning your wheels to actually moving forward." 



"What is the interest rate? What is the fee?"



"Here’s the good news — the program operates at 0% interest. Your balances are reduced... The fee structure? It's built into the plan... 6.25% per year over four years, totaling 25%. (28% Turnbull) But you don’t pay anything until results are delivered. No upfront fees. No surprises." 



"Why will the creditors accept less than the balance owed"



"Because they’ve already collected plenty through interest and late fees. And once an account is not being paid directly anymore, their next best option is to settle and write off the rest. They’re not losing... Plus, they get a tax write-off for doing so. It’s all part of their model." 



"What if I get a 1099?"



"That can happen when a portion of your debt is forgiven — but don’t panic. The IRS provides Form 982, which may exempt you if you were financially insolvent at the time... If one does show up, your tax preparer will know what to do." 



"Why can’t I do this on my own?"



"You can — but here’s the challenge: if you get a settlement offer for $10,000, they expect you to pay it in a lump sum. Most people can’t do that... We pool your debt with thousands of others and negotiate as a group — that gives us leverage to get better deals and spread the payments over time." 



"I'll never retire!!!"



"Here’s what we really need to focus on — getting this debt taken care of and putting you in a position to win... That way, if you do end up working during retirement, it’s because you want to by choice — not because you feel like you have to. That’s a big difference, right?" 



"GUARANTEE. GUARANTEE ME."



"Legally, we can’t use the word 'guarantee'... But what I can tell you is this — the numbers we go over are conservative. In fact, most clients end up graduating faster than the original term. That’s because we already know what your creditors typically settle for... So while we can’t promise perfection, we are confident. Because this isn’t a guess — it’s a strategy that works... Does that make sense?" 



"What is the Freedom Guarantee?"



"The Freedom Debt Relief Guarantee is a safety net... If, at the end of the program, the total amount you paid toward settlements (including our fees) ends up being more than the amount of debt you originally enrolled, we’ll refund you the difference from the fees we collected — up to 100%... This isn’t a savings guarantee — it’s a refund promise..." 





"Client reluctant to move forward"



"I get it. You’ve been burned, misled, or overwhelmed before... Look theres two types of people — someone who in a year from now is still carrying the debt... The other decides to make a change today... Which one best describes you? ...This is why were on the phone today. So lets start saving you money, okay?" 



Client Communication (General)



When texting, calling, leaving voicemails, or emailing clients: 



NEVER SAY: "I'm following up with you…" or "checking in with you." (it's too salesy) 





Instead say: "Hey \_\_\_\_, its Josh from Advantage 1st. Oh my gosh… I finally just had some time to actually get back to you! Okay, I know we talked before about you getting outside help to ….."
