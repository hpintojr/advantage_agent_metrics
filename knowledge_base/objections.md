(e.g., "Does that make sense?")Pivot naturally back to the script.Objections are opportunities to connect.Application Objections"What company is this?""We're Advantage First Financial — we help clients access unsecured personal loans and financial solutions tailored to pay off debt... Most people use them to consolidate credit cards... Just out of curiosity, what do you think your current debt load is?”"Can you call me later?"“Absolutely — what time works best for you? ... Hey you know what if you want, I’ll just ask one or two quick questions now so I can have some real options ready when I call back. Sound good? Is it all credit cards or what kind of debt is that?""I want to look you up"“Totally understand. Please do — we're very proud of our reputation... Our main site is adv1st.com, and you’ll see we have an A+ rating with the BBB and over 1,000 five-star reviews on Trustpilot...""My Credit isn't Good"“No worries — we actually specialize in working with people who don’t have perfect credit. We work with a wide network of lenders, and you’d be surprised what’s possible. What do you do for work right now?”"I never applied."“You were likely pre-qualified through our system — maybe you saw us on Facebook, got a letter, or came through one of our financial partners. The good news is, the approval guidelines have recently opened up... Let me ask — how much are you paying monthly toward your credit cards right now?”"What's the Rate? Can you beat my rate?"“Great question — rates start as low as 5.99%... Best part? We never put clients in a worse position than they're already in — that’s part of our policy... What are your monthly payments looking like right now?"Debt Settlement Objections"How is this going to affect my credit?"Rebuttal #1 (Technical): "Thats the best part! This program is regulated under federal guidelines... Right now, your credit is impacted because of high balances and utilization. As your debt gets paid down on the new terms, your credit worthiness improves. In about 6 months, we usually start seeing credit scores and lendability rise..."Rebuttal #1b (Emotional): "I totally get it... When I had debt, I thought it was my credit I was worried about, but really, it was the stress. The debt caused the stress, not the credit score. Once your debt starts going down, your credit usually follows and improves. But the biggest win? No more stress. That’s priceless, right?""I have to talk to my spouse""I 100% agree! I’m the same way — I talk to my [spouse] about everything. You know your [spouse] better than anyone. Will they be more excited about the 20-year plan you’re on, or the new [X]-year plan we’ve built? ... Why don’t we do this: Let’s get you approved, lock in this payment, and I’ll send you an email with all the details you can share with them.""I want to think about it""I totally understand... But what we just reviewed isn't based on opinions — it's based on the hard numbers from your application. And the numbers show you’re on a 20-year plan, losing $[X] every month to interest. The new plan saves you $[Y] and gets you out in [Z] years. Honestly, what's there to think about other than how you're going to spend that extra money?""I can’t afford this""I appreciate you sharing that. But 'can’t afford' is exactly why we’re on the phone. You can't afford to keep paying $[X] a month to your creditors... This new plan is based on the budget we built together. This is the one payment you can afford...""Client reluctant to move forward""I get it. You’ve been burned, misled, or overwhelmed before... Look theres two types of people — someone who in a year from now is still carrying the debt... The other decides to make a change today... Which one best describes you?"
