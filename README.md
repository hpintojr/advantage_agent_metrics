Agent Performance & Knowledge BaseThis repository stores the official business logic, agent information, and metric definitions for the Advantage First team. It is used to generate accurate performance reports by processing raw CSV data.How This WorksThis system is built for a "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) workflow.Knowledge Base (/knowledge_base): We store all static information (agent lists, metric definitions, business rules) as simple Markdown files. This replaces parsing the PDF, making it 100% accurate.Logic (/src): A Python script (metrics_calculator.py) contains all the pandas logic required to process raw data files.Data (Provided at Runtime): The Python script is designed to process raw CSV exports (e.g., Call_Logs.csv, retention_report.csv).To run a report, the AI will:Read the definitions from the /knowledge_base.Run the script from /src.Load the CSV files you provide.Generate the final, accurate metrics.Knowledge Base File Structure/knowledge_base/agents.md: The single source of truth for the agent & manager roster./knowledge_base/definitions.md: Defines all metric formulas and performance standards (e.g., "Mindset of Execution")./knowledge_base/scripting.md: Contains all talk tracks, from call opening to "pain painting" and milestones./knowledge_base/objections.md: A complete library of all Application and Debt Settlement objection handling./knowledge_base/compliance.md: Holds all legal rules, disclosures, and program guarantees./knowledge_base/debt_pools.md: The definitive list of acceptable and unacceptable debt types./knowledge_base/operations.md: Contains info on systems, software, lead sources, and state-by-state program availability.
